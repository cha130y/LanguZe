# LanguZe — API Design

- **Document status:** Draft v0.1 — questions raised while writing, and their decisions, are in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-questions-raised-while-writing-the-api-design)
- **Date:** 2026-09-19
- **Release covered:** Release 1.0
- **Source:** [SRS](../requirements/SRS.md) v0.10, [use cases](../requirements/use-cases.md), [process flows](../flows/README.md), [data model](data-model.md), [ADR-0003](adr/0003-better-auth-in-api.md), [ADR-0004](adr/0004-ai-provider.md)
- **Next:** implementation, starting with the Prisma schema, the first migration, and the `auth` module

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the HTTP API between the web app and the API for Release 1.0: conventions, every LanguZe endpoint, error codes, and limits. The OpenAPI document generated from the NestJS controllers (served at `/docs` outside production) becomes the exact contract once the endpoints exist; this document is the plan it is built from and is kept in step with it.

## 2. Conventions

### 2.1 Paths and versions

- LanguZe endpoints live under `/v1` (E1). Changes within `v1` are additive only: new endpoints, new optional request fields, new response fields. A breaking change would need `/v2`.
- Better Auth's own endpoints live under `/auth`, and only the two that provider sign-in needs are served (section 3.1, ADR-0003); every other path there answers `NOT_FOUND`.
- `GET /health` (already implemented) and `/docs` (OpenAPI, not in production) stay at the root.
- Resource names are plural nouns; IDs in paths are UUIDs. A request for another learner's resource returns `404`, never `403`, so it reveals nothing about what exists (FR-008).

### 2.2 Requests and responses

- JSON with `camelCase` field names, except the photo upload (`multipart/form-data`) and the tutor stream (`text/event-stream`).
- Times are ISO 8601 strings in UTC, such as `2026-09-19T07:30:00Z`. Values that are calendar days in `Asia/Bangkok` (V1) are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.
- Enum values are the upper-case names from the [data model](data-model.md#6-enums), such as `READY` or `FAMILIAR`.
- Request bodies are validated at the boundary with class-validator DTOs; unknown fields are rejected (already configured). Limits come from the SRS, including V19.
- Lists that can grow without bound (tutor messages, the audit log) use cursor pagination: `?limit=` (default 20, at most 50) and `?cursor=`, with `nextCursor` in the response, `null` on the last page. Lists with a small fixed maximum (at most 20 worlds, 10 questions) are returned whole.
- Photos are returned as short-lived signed links, never as permanent addresses (P4).

### 2.3 Sessions and cross-site protection

- The session is Better Auth's cookie, sent by the browser automatically: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, shared across LanguZe subdomains in production (A1, ADR-0003).
- CORS allows only the web app's origin, with credentials. The current CORS setup must add `credentials: true`.
- Every request that changes data must carry an allowed `Origin` header. With `SameSite=Lax` cookies, this blocks cross-site request forgery even for form-style requests such as the photo upload.
- Every endpoint requires a signed-in account unless marked **public**. Status, role, verification, and AI suspension are read from the database on each request (NFR-019).

### 2.4 Errors

Every error has the same shape (E2):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DAILY_ANALYSIS_LIMIT",
    "message": "The daily photo analysis limit has been reached.",
    "details": { "resetsAt": "2026-09-19T17:00:00Z" }
  }
}
```

- `code` is stable and machine-readable; the web app shows Thai text for each code (NFR-013).
- `message` is English, for developers and logs; it is never shown to learners as is.
- `details` is optional and specific to the code.
- Validation errors use `VALIDATION_FAILED` with `details.fields`, a list of the fields and the rules they broke.

| Status | Used for                                                                                           |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`  | The request is malformed or breaks a validation rule.                                              |
| `401`  | No valid session.                                                                                  |
| `403`  | Signed in, but not allowed: account suspended, not an admin, not verified, AI suspended, under 18. |
| `404`  | The resource does not exist or belongs to someone else.                                            |
| `409`  | The resource is in the wrong state for the request, such as retrying a world that is `READY`.      |
| `413`  | The photo is larger than 10 MB.                                                                    |
| `415`  | The photo is not JPEG, PNG, or WebP.                                                               |
| `429`  | A rate limit or a daily limit is reached; `Retry-After` and `details.resetsAt` say when to retry.  |
| `500`  | Unexpected error. The response carries the request ID so the error can be found in the logs.       |
| `503`  | A required service (database, AI provider, photo storage) is unavailable.                          |

## 3. Endpoints

### 3.1 Authentication (`/v1/auth`)

Better Auth runs inside the API (ADR-0003), but learners reach it through LanguZe endpoints, so every answer uses the error format of section 2.4 and the rate limits of section 5.

| Method | Path                               | Purpose                                                                                                                             | Requirements                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/sign-up`                 | Email, password, display name, year of birth, and accepting the Terms; signs the learner in and sends the verification email; `201` | FR-001, FR-004, FR-090, V20 |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/sign-in`                 | Email and password                                                                                                                  | FR-002, FR-105              |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/sign-out`                | Ends this browser's session; `204`                                                                                                  | FR-002                      |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/send-verification-email` | Sends a new verification email                                                                                                      | FR-004                      |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/verify-email`            | Verifies the address with the token from the email                                                                                  | FR-004                      |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/request-password-reset`  | Sends a reset link                                                                                                                  | FR-005                      |
| `POST` | `/v1/auth/reset-password`          | Sets a new password and ends every session                                                                                          | FR-005, S7                  |
| `GET`  | `/v1/auth/providers`               | Which provider sign-ins this API offers, in the order to show them                                                                  | FR-003                      |

- Sign-up and sign-in answer with the account, in the same shape as `GET /v1/me`, and set the session cookie.
- Sign-up is refused with `TERMS_NOT_ACCEPTED` (`400`), `AGE_BELOW_MINIMUM` (`403`, V20), or `EMAIL_ALREADY_REGISTERED` (`409`, U7). An under-age answer also sets a short `HttpOnly` cookie that blocks further attempts from that browser for 24 hours. A placeholder address (D1) is refused as invalid, so nobody can claim the address a provider identity resolves to.
- `/v1/auth/providers` answers `{ "providers": ["google", "line"] }` and needs no session. It lists the providers whose credentials are configured, so the web app never shows a button that cannot work.
- Sign-in is refused with `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` (`401`), which never says whether the address is known, or `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` (`403`) once the password has confirmed the person (FR-105).
- The two email endpoints always answer `{ "ok": true }`, whether or not the address has an account (FR-005).
- Verification and reset links point at the web app, which sends the token to the API. A used or expired token is answered with `INVALID_TOKEN` (`400`).
- `DELETE /v1/me` answers `204` and signs the browser out. The confirmation word is the API's own guard, so one stray request can never delete an account; the learner confirms on screen as well (FR-007, US-009). Anything else in `confirmation` is `VALIDATION_FAILED` (`400`) and deletes nothing. Everything belonging to the account goes with it through the schema's cascades; stored photos are removed within 24 hours by the storage module (NFR-009, V10).

Provider sign-in is the exception: the provider sends the browser straight back to the API, so these two routes are Better Auth's own and answer in its format. Nothing else of Better Auth's is served — its own sign-up, for example, would skip the age check and the Terms.

| Method | Path                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                      | Requirements           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `POST` | `/auth/sign-in/social`      | Starts a provider sign-in and answers the provider's address, which the web app opens                                                        | FR-003                 |
| `GET`  | `/auth/callback/{provider}` | The provider's return. Signs the learner in and redirects to the web app: home, the Terms step for a new account, or `/sign-in?error=<code>` | FR-003, FR-009, FR-090 |

### 3.2 Account (`auth` module)

| Method   | Path                   | Purpose                                                                                    | Requirements           |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/v1/me`               | The signed-in account and what it may do                                                   | FR-006, FR-096, FR-108 |
| `POST`   | `/v1/me/terms`         | Complete a pending provider sign-up: accept the Terms, confirm display name, year of birth | FR-090, V20            |
| `POST`   | `/v1/me/terms/decline` | Decline: removes the pending sign-up and signs out                                         | FR-090                 |
| `GET`    | `/v1/me/usage`         | Analyses left today and when they reset; tutor messages follow in their own increment      | FR-080                 |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/me`               | Delete the account; body `{ "confirmation": "DELETE" }`                                    | FR-007                 |

`GET /v1/me` returns:

```json
{
  "id": "0192f0c1-8c1e-7cc3-9d2a-5b3e1c4a7f10",
  "name": "Nok",
  "email": "nok@example.com",
  "emailVerified": true,
  "verifiedForAi": true,
  "role": "LEARNER",
  "termsAccepted": true,
  "aiAccess": {
    "available": true,
    "reason": null,
    "until": null,
    "awaitingReview": false
  }
}
```

- `id` is the account ID learners can quote to LanguZe (FR-108).
- `email` is `null` for accounts with a placeholder address (D1).
- While `termsAccepted` is `false` (a pending provider sign-up), every other endpoint returns `TERMS_PENDING` (`403`).
- `aiAccess.reason` is `NOT_VERIFIED` or `AI_SUSPENDED` when AI features are unavailable.

### 3.3 Worlds (`worlds` module)

| Method   | Path                                        | Purpose                                                              | Requirements                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/v1/worlds`                                | List worlds with status, thumbnail link, word and mastered counts    | FR-013                        |
| `POST`   | `/v1/worlds`                                | Create a world: `multipart/form-data` with `name` and `photo`; `202` | FR-010–FR-012, FR-017, FR-020 |
| `GET`    | `/v1/worlds/{worldId}`                      | Photo link, status, and words with meaning, CEFR level, mastery, box | FR-014                        |
| `GET`    | `/v1/worlds/{worldId}/status`               | Status only, for polling every 3 seconds (P3)                        | FR-021                        |
| `PATCH`  | `/v1/worlds/{worldId}`                      | Rename: `{ "name": "..." }`                                          | FR-016                        |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/worlds/{worldId}`                      | Delete the world; `204`                                              | FR-015                        |
| `POST`   | `/v1/worlds/{worldId}/retry`                | Retry a failed analysis on the same photo; `202`                     | FR-025                        |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/worlds/{worldId}/words/{occurrenceId}` | Remove a word from the world; `204`                                  | FR-026, FR-027                |

- Creating a world returns `202 Accepted` with the world in `ANALYZING`; the analysis runs in the background (P2) and the words appear when it finishes. The daily limit is decided before the photo is stored, so a learner who has none left ends up with no world and no file (FR-020).
- A world carries `thumbnailUrl` and, when opened, `photoUrl`: signed links that work for a few minutes and only for that object (P4). They are empty when the photo is gone.
- Uploads are `multipart/form-data` and are kept in memory only; the file is prepared before anything is stored, and the original is never written down (FR-017).
- Creation and retry can fail with `NOT_VERIFIED` or `AI_SUSPENDED` (`403`), `WORLD_LIMIT_REACHED` (`409`), `DAILY_ANALYSIS_LIMIT` (`429`), `PHOTO_TOO_LARGE` (`413`), or `PHOTO_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED` (`415`).
- Retry fails with `RETRY_NOT_AVAILABLE` (`409`) when the world is not `FAILED` or its photo was blocked.
- Removing the last word fails with `LAST_WORD` (`409`).
- A `FAILED` world carries `failureReason` (`BLOCKED`, `TOO_FEW_WORDS`, `PROVIDER_ERROR`, `INVALID_OUTPUT`, `TIMED_OUT`), which the web app turns into the right message and actions.

### 3.4 Practice sessions (`learning` module)

| Method | Path                                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                         | Requirements                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/v1/sessions/current?kind=GAME&worldId=` or `?kind=REVIEW` | The open session within 24 hours, if any; `204` when there is none                                                              | FR-036, V17                   |
| `POST` | `/v1/sessions`                                              | Start a session: `{ "kind": "GAME", "worldId": "..." }` or `{ "kind": "REVIEW" }`; abandons an open one of the same kind; `201` | FR-030, FR-050, FR-051        |
| `GET`  | `/v1/sessions/{sessionId}`                                  | Progress, the next question, and the summary once completed                                                                     | FR-031, FR-035, FR-036        |
| `POST` | `/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/questions/{questionId}/answer`    | Answer: `{ "answer": "sofa" }` or `{ "dontKnow": true }`                                                                        | FR-032–FR-034, FR-042, FR-060 |

A session's next question never includes the answer (FR-032):

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "kind": "GAME",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "answeredCount": 4,
  "questionCount": 10,
  "nextQuestion": {
    "id": "…",
    "position": 5,
    "photoUrl": "https://…signed…",
    "box": { "x": 0.12, "y": 0.4, "width": 0.25, "height": 0.2 }
  },
  "summary": null
}
```

An answer returns the feedback, and the summary when it was the last question:

```json
{
  "correct": false,
  "dontKnow": false,
  "alreadyAnswered": false,
  "word": {
    "english": "sofa",
    "thaiMeaning": "โซฟา",
    "exampleSentence": "I sit on the sofa."
  },
  "xpAwarded": 0,
  "mastery": { "before": "FAMILIAR", "after": "LEARNING" },
  "sessionCompleted": false,
  "summary": null
}
```

- Answering the same question again returns the recorded result with `alreadyAnswered: true` and changes nothing (FR-034, S5).
- `WORLD_NOT_READY` (`409`), `NOTHING_TO_REVIEW` (`409`, FR-053), `SESSION_CLOSED` (`409`), and `QUESTION_UNAVAILABLE` (`409`, word removed since the session started) cover the other states.
- The summary lists the correct count, the XP earned, and the words whose level changed with their new level (FR-035).

### 3.5 Progress (`progress` module)

| Method | Path           | Purpose                                                                          | Requirements   |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `GET`  | `/v1/progress` | Total XP, words at each mastery level, and each world's word and mastered counts | FR-060, FR-061 |

### 3.6 Tutor (`tutor` module)

| Method   | Path                 | Purpose                                                | Requirements           |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/v1/tutor/messages` | The conversation, newest first, with cursor pagination | FR-070                 |
| `POST`   | `/v1/tutor/messages` | Send `{ "content": "..." }`; the reply streams back    | FR-070–FR-075, NFR-003 |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/tutor/messages` | Clear the conversation; `204`                          | FR-076                 |

Sending a message answers with `text/event-stream` (P6), with these events:

| Event   | Data                                                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delta` | `{ "text": "..." }`, the next part of the reply                               |
| `done`  | `{ "messageId": "…", "replyId": "…", "messagesLeft": 21 }`                    |
| `error` | `{ "code": "AI_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE" }`; nothing is saved or counted (FR-071) |

- Browsers can only open event streams for `GET` requests with `EventSource`, so the web app reads this `POST` response with `fetch` and a stream reader.
- Before the stream starts, the request can fail with `NOT_VERIFIED` or `AI_SUSPENDED` (`403`), `MESSAGE_TOO_LONG` (`400`, V7), or `DAILY_TUTOR_LIMIT` (`429`).

### 3.7 Administration (`moderation` module, `/v1/admin`)

All admin endpoints require the `ADMIN` role, checked on every request; anyone else gets `404`, so the admin area is invisible to them (FR-100, FR-102, NFR-019).

| Method | Path                                         | Purpose                                                                          | Requirements   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `GET`  | `/v1/admin/review-queue`                     | Cases awaiting review, oldest first, with block counts and categories            | FR-103         |
| `GET`  | `/v1/admin/learners?email=` or `?accountId=` | Find one learner by exact email or account ID; `404` when none                   | FR-108         |
| `GET`  | `/v1/admin/learners/{learnerId}`             | The moderation record: blocks, suspensions, account age, sign-in methods, status | FR-104         |
| `POST` | `/v1/admin/learners/{learnerId}/actions`     | `{ "action": "SET_AI_SUSPENSION_END", "reason": "...", "endsAt": "..." }`        | FR-105, FR-106 |
| `GET`  | `/v1/admin/audit-log`                        | Admin actions, newest first, with cursor pagination                              | FR-106         |

- The moderation record never contains photos, tutor messages, worlds, or words (FR-104).
- Actions fail with `OWN_ACCOUNT` (`403`), `ACTION_NOT_APPLICABLE` (`409`, for example reactivating an active account), or `VALIDATION_FAILED` for a missing reason or an end date in the past.
- Searching by a placeholder email address finds nothing; learners without an email address are found by account ID (D1).

## 4. Error codes

The generic codes (`BAD_REQUEST`, `FORBIDDEN`, `CONFLICT`, `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE`, `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`) are used when the framework or shared infrastructure raises an error without a more specific code. The list lives in `apps/api/src/platform/errors/error-codes.ts`.

| Code                       | Status | Meaning                                                                                |

## 5. Rate limits and other defaults

Starting values, all configurable per environment (E3). Rate limits are kept in the API's memory (A2) and answer `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After`.

| What                                    | Limit                     | Keyed by                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Email sign-in                           | 5 attempts per 15 minutes | Email address and IP           |
| Sign-up                                 | 5 per hour                | IP                             |
| Password reset and verification emails  | 3 per hour                | Email address                  |
| Photo upload and retry                  | 5 per minute              | Account                        |
| Tutor messages                          | 10 per minute             | Account                        |
| Admin actions                           | 30 per minute             | Admin account                  |
| Any other request                       | 120 per minute            | Account, or IP when signed out |
| Provider sign-in and callback (`/auth`) | 120 per minute            | IP                             |
| Lifetime of a signed photo link         | 15 minutes                | —                              |

The daily limits of the SRS (10 analyses, 30 tutor messages) are separate and apply on top of these.

## 6. Contract between web and API

- The NestJS controllers and DTOs, with their OpenAPI decorators, are the source of the contract; the OpenAPI document is generated from them.
- The web app's request and response types are generated from that OpenAPI document (E4), so a change in the API shows up as a type error in the web app instead of a bug at runtime.
- Each endpoint gets an API end-to-end test that covers its success case and its main error codes; the acceptance criteria of the stories list them.

## Appendix A. Questions raised while writing the API design

Better Auth's default is `/api/auth`, which would repeat "api" on the `api.` subdomain; ADR-0003 now says `/auth`.                                                                                                                                          | All endpoints; ADR-0003  | Confirmed 2026-09-19 |
| E2  | What does an error look like?                        | One shape everywhere: a stable `code`, an English `message` for developers, and optional `details`. The web app shows Thai text for each code, so wording can change without an API release, and a later English interface needs no API change.                                                                                                              | All endpoints; web app   | Confirmed 2026-09-19 |
| E3  | What are the starting rate limits and link lifetime? | The values in section 5. They are strict enough to stop password guessing and email flooding, loose enough that a learner playing quickly never meets them, and all can be changed per environment.                                                                                                                                                          | Section 5; configuration | Confirmed 2026-09-19 |
| E4  | How does the web app get the API's types?            | Generate TypeScript types from the OpenAPI document with `openapi-typescript`, a development-only dependency of the web app, run by a script whenever the API changes. The alternatives are hand-written types, which drift from the API, or a shared package, which ADR-0001 reserves for stable contracts and which the OpenAPI document already provides. | Web app; tooling         | Confirmed 2026-09-19 |
